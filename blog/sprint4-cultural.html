       <h1>Core 4 Neuroplasticity and Hinengaro</h1>
               
        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to adapt to changes. It was until quite recently thought to be only during ‘critical periods’ of our developmental years when the brain is more adaptable to change, i.e. in childhood and teenage years. “When you’re young your mind is open to change, but it’s use it or lose it.”  While it is true that children have an unmatched neuroplasticity, the principle of neuroplasticity is that this morphic process is an ongoing condition of the brain for our entire lives. Just learning that the brain is more adaptable throughout our lives benefits students who are trying to learn something new.

            When I thought about learning to code properly, I felt that I had lost the opportunity to time. I was considered to be a bit techy as a kid and encouraged as a teenager in the 90s to pursue computing by my teachers. I chose to pursue art, and that felt like a choice between two doors. Even though my art would frequently make use of computational principles and techniques I still felt that my decision was made a long time ago. The principles of neuroplasticity show that the ‘critical developmental period’ never ends until you die. I like this. It gives rise to a different voice in your head when doubt creeps in, it's like "are you dead? No, so learn to code."

        <h3>Ways to Increase Your Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
            Plasticising your brain can be harmful. Physcial trauma, disease and physchoactive drugs can increase plasticity. The right thing to do is to stike a balance between the increased openness and stability. The practices of meditation, mindfulness and yoga among other things can increase neuroplasticity and it don't have the same potential for over-plasticizing your brain. If one is aiming to learn something it makes sense to keep as much as possible outside of that area as stable as possible.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
            Growth Mindset is the collection of beliefs which an individual hold about their capacity to improve in a given area. It is possible to hold both a growth mindset and fixed mindset in different areas.

        <p>
            I initially thought that this was an overarching tendency, such as the way a personality typology like Myers Briggs characterizes a person as a whole as either holding a Judging or Perceiving preference. But the fixed/growth mindset spectrum applies to me differently for different things. I had a fixed mindset when it came to learning to code.

        <p> 
            Growth mindset is about changing the attribution of difficulty in the learning process from a negative to a positive. Among other things, every time I find something difficult, I will consciously tell myself that this difficulty is exactly what I need to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/isHM1rEd3GE">Teaching a Growth Mindset - Carol Dweck</a>
        </p> 
        <p>        
            My learning strategy is to try to apply the course material to an art problem, even if just to imagine this being done. To combine this with a growth mindset will mean growing my concepts and thoughts about what my art is while also growing my belief of what I can do.
