        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            I am very impressed with the pairing of core components with the tech components. I feel like if I was doing the same material in my own time through the various online platforms I might've easily told myself the story that I don't need the foundations core material. This would be a huge mistake, because it might even be the primary reason that the EDA method works. I have learnt so much so quickly. It's so interesting because facing ones own self-defeating stories, mindsets, strengths and habits is critical to the learning model. I would even go as far as to say that mindset is the primary reason that I haven't learnt to code properly earlier. I had set up a block. I didn't know that about myself. How many more blocks have I set up? I learnt that I am quite hard on myself. Through reflections and core work I am now generally more careful and organised and productive and perhaps most importantly I've changed my attributional style. Now when I encounter a problem, or a setback I don't take it out on myself. What I mean by this is that when I'm working out what something means, I don't take it personally. This feels nicer for a start. I use words like, I just haven't worked this out yet. But also, this makes me better at discovering the actual problem and then fixing it. It still takes conscious thought and I know that I will face more barriers in coding and in life, but I can see that I'm in a better position to do that already. Kia ora EDA.
