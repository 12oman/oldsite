        <h2>HTML and CSS (and Javascript)</h2>
        <p>HTML is a screenplay and CSS is a Movie. It's a bad analogy because Javascript is more Movie-ish. But if you think of various film production departments like props, costumes, photography each of them has a relationsihp to the underlying 'screenplay' as the primary logic to work from. It is suitable too, because sometimes, and perhaps in the most interesting movies the screenplays are dynamically improvised and rewritten 'live' with the talents of specfic actors. Which is exactly what we can do with Javascript</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Control and Flow Loops</h2>
        <p>The statements <code>for</code>, <code>if</code> and <code>while</code> are control flow statements in programming. They control the flow of what gets done. If you imagine a network of train tracks the control statements are the sections of track which direct the train to go down a specific track. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>The Dom</h2>
        <p>Continuing train analogys we could describe <i>the DOM</i> or document object model as something like Harry Beck's famous London Underground tube map. <q>Rather than emphasising distance and geographical accuracy, like other maps, Beck based his on the circuit diagrams he drew for his day job; stripping the sprawling Tube network down to a neat diagram of coloured, criss-crossing lines.</q> The DOM, like the tube map is a diagram with a navagational logic. The DOM makes HTML and CSS elements addressable, the tube map made the london stations accessable. Just like the way that an overwhelming tangle of tracks and stations is cleanly represented by a schema of nodes. What that means is that the HTML structure and CSS rule and even the browser window can be 'travelled to' by the code from JavaScript.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
        <p>Because Javascript is an object oriented language and I have read some Speculative Realism, to me it seemed to imply the object-oriented maxim 'everything that exists is an object. This is kind of true, but the two do not neatly align. Arrays are objects with charactertics well-suited for enumerational functions, like shuffling a deck of cards. Notably, they store information differently from other objects. So there are array objects and object objects. Arrays are like an excel spreadsheet with no header row cells, whereas Objects have key values and property values. 
            <ul>
                <li>Arrays have square brackets [] and values are defined by their position within the array. They can accept all types of enty <code>strings</code><br></li>
                <li>Objects have curly brackets {} and are defined by name values and property values sometimes refered to as key/value pairs. {} JSON</li>
            </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>A function is a piece of code which 'runs when it is called'. But what does that mean? Is it like a confident child who has decided to respond to the parental directive, 'it's time to get in the car now' by running in the opposite direction? Functions are totally obiedient. I have started to think about it as a button; not an button for a person to push, but a button for a program to push. Calling a function is the equivalent of pushing a button. Zaap! Bizzt! Door opens! Whatever. It will do whatever we tell it to do. Depending on the 'scope' of the function vairous parts of the program can push the button.</p>
