       <p>I found the <strong>emotional intelligence</strong> section more practical than I expected.</p>
       <p>I have to admit that the notion of emotional intelligence seemed to have a whiff of privilege-apologising to my ears.<br> 
        Emotional intelligence as a predictor or success seemed to me to be a backwardly running machine. <br>
        Does succes make it easier to 'behave appropriately' and also, perhaps more importantly, does being in the group who decides what equals appropriate behavior tend to behave more appropriately? Of course it does!</p>
        <p>Still, I put these thoughts aside and tried to really listen to the texts (as if I was playing the listening looping game.) 
        <br>I found the notion of <strong>learned helplessness</strong> to be an interesting one, because I think that many of the characteristics of the learned helpless subject apply to the processes of colonialism and to contemporary artists. And also this would be how I felt about learning to code. I basically gave up trying. We learn that our efforts do not have an effect on the dysfunctional systems in our lives and so give up trying to get around them, change them, or change ourselves. #unlearningHelplessness</p>
        <p>Also interesting is the concept of <strong>attribution</strong>: the story we tell ourselves of the meaning and cause of an event or experience, such as getting an A+. Each of us can be said to have an <strong>attributional style</strong>, a default pattern of story telling to ourselves of what something means. It is preferable to have a style which sees negative outcomes as temporary and external to us (I didn't get an A+ this time because I am juggling many life factors), and positive outcomes as permanent and internal (I got an A+ because I am good). The short story of this is that we can change our attributional style, it's not fixed.
