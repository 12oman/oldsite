       <h2>blocked on a simple problem</h2>>
        <p>       
            I had been coding a test problem the night before. Feeling pretty ready to give up. It didn't work. I spent hours retesting my code. I tried it in different browsers and test environments. I gave up for the night and had a restless sleep. My girlfriend got annoyed with me. I was not popular, even with myself.

            The problem was that I needed to know the difference between a parameter and an argument. Getting confused about this is not fun.  
        </p>
        <p>
            A parameter is a way to get the data where it needs to go within a piece of code. A parameter is like the bus and an argument is like a passanger. When you pass information into a parameter it becomes the passanger.

            I worked this out by the ducky method. The ducky method is inspired by the rubber ducky method of talking to a rubber duck, but involves going outside and give the visiting ducks some rolled oats and tell them the problem.

            I also worked out that it is not good to try to explain your programming problems to non-coding friends lol.

       <h2>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
       <p>
           Fizzbuzz is an interview question for programmers. It's like the 'where do you see yourself in 5 years?' You better have an answer for it. You need to write a program to prove that you can program. The question is to replace multiples of 3 and 5 up to 100 with a silly word. It seems simple. I first thought of dynamically creating a times table in one list and then overlaying that list with the numbers 1- 100. Then asking a question: is a number is in the buzz list, replace it with buzz. Is the number is the fizz list, replace it with fizz. It felt like a Dr. Seuss book. <br> 
           But in starting to work this out I remembered that modulo % aka the percent sign gives you what is called modulous congruence between two mumbers, ie there is no remainer. A way to visualise this is that it's like a tiled floor where all the tiles are square and fit perfectly without being cut. It doesn't matter what the size of the tile is or the room, it is their congruence that matters. Tilers need Fizzbuzz.<br>
           This is of course, the actual correct way to do it. I coded it and check my answer against the solution and they were nearly identical. This made me feel smart.

           What I learned is that having a visualisation of the data that is both vivid and applicable to the problem is super helpful for me to search the solution space. Thinking again of a the tiled floor analogy. My original proposed solution would be equivalent to having to draw the floor for each number between 1 - 100. That would work, and it is an artists solution (see variations of open and incomplete cubes by Sol Lewitt), but it is not an elegant one.
